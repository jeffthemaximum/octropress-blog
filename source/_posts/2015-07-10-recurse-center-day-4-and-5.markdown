I've finally defeated object oriented programming! Man, I never thought I'd be able to use classes and objects in a project, but I finally got a basic OOP-style tic tac toe game to work in python. [Check it out here](https://github.com/jeffthemaximum/python-tic-tac-toe).

This was the article that finally helped my understand OOP in python: [Improve Your Python: Python Classes and Object Oriented Programming](http://jeffknupp.com/blog/2014/06/18/improve-your-python-python-classes-and-object-oriented-programming/). Thanks to Aagje for pointing me to that article!

Friday was kind of a quick day for me, but I learned a lot. I went to a [git](https://git-scm.com/) workshop with [Tom](https://twitter.com/ballingt) all morning, and it was a big help. Tom is like a ninja programmer, and it's kind of hard to keep up with his lightening quick ninja skills sometimes, especially for pink belt like me. But, he imparted some serious git knowledge during this session, and I'm glad I went. I solidified my basic git knowledge, which should come in helpful for keeping my blog from crashing again!

OOP has been beating me up for the last few days, but I decided to finally conquer it. I want to learn how to use OOP-style in my coding, and I just haven't been able to do it for a while now. On Thursday, I got started on a simple, OOP style tic tact toe game, but then I left early with [Emily](http://emilyelizabethcooksandstuff.blogspot.com/) to go to a friend's wedding in Jersey, so I had to leave my game for the day.

On Friday, I picked back up with tic tac toe, and I got it to work! Go Jeff! 

I've been coding for about 2 years now, with my most solid learning happening in the past 10 months or so. Learning to do more and more with programming is addicting. You learn a little, use it, make something new, and you see your effort pay off in results. That effort --> results loop gets addicting! You keep learning more, and you can do more, and you just want to learn more and more! 

This successful stab at OOP programming in python with my tic tac toe game showed me yet again that if I put in the effort, I can keep learning harder and harder programming concepts!

Friday is optional at RC, so I ended up not going in. I still did a bunch of coding at home, including reviving my crashed blog and finishing that tic tac toe game. But, I also went to the Women's World Cup US National Team ticker tape parade on Wall Street with Emily and Lisa!

The coding is addicting, but it's your friends and family that matter most. Sometimes, ya gotta break yourself away from that screen and hang out with some cool peeps.
